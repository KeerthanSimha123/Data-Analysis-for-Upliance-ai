# Data-Analysis-for-Upliance-ai
The project is to do the data analysis and do the descriptive analysis using Data Visualization by merging the data sets to achieve the sense of data.

I have loaded the dataset in google colab and further seggregated the data present in different sheets into different databases and performed the data analysis.

Before data analysis, I have done some basic data transformation like data cleaning, by removing null values and dropping the duplicates from the data.

Additionally, I have merged the 3 datasets by using the primary key aka common column . First, I have merged the two databases and further merged with that collated database to another database using UserID and other common column.

I also have performed data analysis using groupby operatinbs and acquired some valuable insights and recorded them in Microsoft word and also recommended some insights for the same.

Finally, I performed the descriptive analysis and got to know what has happened before and drawn the underlying insights from them. It is also useful for explaining to non-technical people with facts and figures,
